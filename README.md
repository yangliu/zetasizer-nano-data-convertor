Zetasizer Nano Data Convertor
=============================

A helper app to simplify the data processing of the data exported by Malvern Zetasizer Nano.

Backed with node-webkit, the code should be able to run smoothly on any platform if you configure it in the right way.

## Pre-built version

Honest, I know most of you who need this code have no idea what is Node.js and what is Webkit, so I decide to offer a pre-built version for Mac users. For Mac loâ™¥ers, you can download it here.

[Download Zetasizer Nano Data Convertor for OS X 10.6+](http://liuy.me/files/zndc.zip) 

Please extract the downloaded file, and copy it to your Application folder.

If you're using OS X Mountain Lion and Maverick, the Security feature may prevent our app from running since it is not properly signed. 
For the first time running this app, you may need to open your Application folder, right click the Zetasizer Nano Data Convertor, and allow it running (Maverick users may need to enter your password).

## To Do

* A CLI interface for batch process
* Group specific measurements and export them together
* Linux version
* A cross-platform web app

## Not To Do

* Windows version (I don't have any computer running Windows, although the Malvern software itself running on the Windows). If you really need a Windows version, I encourage you make it yourself based on my code. It will takes you less than 1 hour even you don't have any experiences on node-webkit.
